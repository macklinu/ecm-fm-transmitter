Arduino FM Transmitter
===

This repository contains two elements:

+ `radio/radio.ino`: the code to be uploaded to an Arduino FM transmitter
+ `setFM.maxpat`: a [Max](http://cycling74.com/) patch for controlling the Arduino via serial; was used before getting the entire radio wired up

I am looking into finding the schematics used by UMich's Electronic Chamber Music class to better document this project.
